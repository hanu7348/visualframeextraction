Advanced Video Summarization
This repository contains a Streamlit application for advanced video summarization. The application allows users to upload videos, extract key frames, generate captions for each frame using pre-trained models, and summarize the captions into a coherent text summary. The application also includes user authentication and performance metrics visualization.

Installation
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-video-summarization.git
cd advanced-video-summarization
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Initialize the SQLite database:
The database is initialized automatically when the app is first run, but you can also manually initialize it by running:

bash
Copy code
